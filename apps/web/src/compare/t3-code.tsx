          question: "What’s the difference between bb and T3 Code?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Both are free, MIT-licensed apps that run Claude Code, Codex, and
              other coding agents in Git worktrees on your own machines, with
              mobile and remote access, and both let agents hand work to each
              other. bb is built to be changed: install a plugin from the
              marketplace or have an agent build one, instead of keeping a fork.
              And in bb, every agent another agent starts is a full thread you
              can open and message mid-run. bb is also fully scriptable: its CLI
              and SDK can drive anything the app does.
            </p>
          ),
        },
        {
          question: "Is there a free, open-source T3 Code alternative?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Yes: bb. It’s free for any team size and MIT-licensed, so you can
              use and change it for anything, including at work. Plugins add
              whatever you need without forking, and your agents work together
              across providers. <a href="/download/macos">Download bb</a>.

          ),
        },
        {
          question: "How do I move my projects and worktrees to bb?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Ask bb to do it. T3 Code keeps each thread’s worktree as plain Git
              on your machine, in <code>~/.t3/worktrees</code>, so a bb agent
              can add your repos and open each unfinished worktree as a thread.
              Your CLAUDE.md, skills, MCP servers, and agent sign-ins come
              along, and T3 Code keeps working while you try bb.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                When you want a new panel, command, or agent, you install or
                build a plugin instead of patching the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                When an agent starts another, the new one is a full thread you
                can message.
              </li>
              <li>
                Several threads can share one worktree, so a reviewer works
                right next to the agent that wrote the code.

              Yes. bb reads each agent’s own skills and slash commands and shows
              them in that agent’s <code>/</code> menu, so the ones you use
              today keep working.

              Yes. Commit a <code>.bb-env-setup.sh</code> at your repo root and
              bb runs it in every new worktree. List untracked files like{" "}
              <code>.env</code> in <code>.worktreeinclude</code> and bb copies
              them in first, and <code>.bb-env-teardown.sh</code> cleans up when

              bb lets you rewind the conversation instead. Edit any earlier
              message to rerun the thread from there, or fork a new thread from
              any message to try a different approach. In a worktree thread,
              changes stay on that thread’s branch until you merge them.
