            <p>
              Both run Claude Code, Codex, and other coding agents in parallel
              on your repo. bb is free for any team size and open source, while
              Superset charges $15 per user a month for teams, billed yearly. bb
              includes phone and browser access, remote machines, and
              automations at no cost, and runs on{" "}
              <a href={WINDOWS_DOWNLOAD_URL}>Windows</a> (alpha). When one agent
              starts another, the new agent gets its own thread (one
              conversation with one agent) that you can open and message.

            <>
              <p>
                A small, venture-backed team that most recently worked together
                at Figma, building Figma’s plugin platform. The team also
                includes alumni of Meta, Quora, and Mapbox.
              </p>
              <p>
                bb is developed in the open: the core team commits to it every
                day, dozens of community contributors send changes each month,
                and a new release ships every week. Follow along or reach the
                team on <a href="https://github.com/get-bb/bb">GitHub</a> and{" "}

              Yes: bb. It’s free for any team size and MIT-licensed, so you can
              use and change it for anything, including at work. Superset
              charges $15 per user a month for teams, billed yearly, and its

              Ask bb to do it. Your repo and Superset’s worktrees are plain Git
              on your machine, so a bb agent can add the repo and open each
              unfinished worktree as a thread. Superset keeps working while you
              try bb.
