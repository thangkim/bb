          question: "What’s the difference between bb and Cursor?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Cursor is a code editor and agents app built around its own agent,
              with cloud agents, Projects, and automations on its paid plans,
              and it bills Claude and GPT models at API rates. bb is a free,
              open-source app for running coding agents: Claude Code and Codex
              run directly on your Claude and ChatGPT subscriptions, next to
              Cursor’s agent and others, on your own machines, and they can
              start and message each other. Plugins let you change almost
              anything, including adding a code editor.
            </p>
          ),
        },
        {
          question: "Is there a free, open-source Cursor alternative?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Yes, for running coding agents: bb. It’s free for any team size
              and MIT-licensed, so you can use and change it for anything,
              including at work, and Claude Code and Codex run directly on the
              Claude and ChatGPT subscriptions you already have.{" "}

        {
          question: "Can I use Cursor with bb?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Yes. Pick Cursor as the agent for any bb thread: bb runs Cursor’s
              agent CLI with your own sign-in and plan, so your rules and MCP
              servers come along. You can also open any thread’s worktree in
              Cursor with one click.

          ),
        },
        {
          question: "How do I move my agent work to bb?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Ask bb to do it. Cursor’s local worktrees are plain Git on your
              machine, and its cloud agents push their work to branches, so a bb
              agent can add your repo and open each unfinished worktree or
              branch as a thread. Your AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, skills, and MCP
              servers come along, and Cursor keeps working while you try bb.

              Yes. Every bb thread runs in the background on the machine you
              pick: your laptop, an always-on desktop, or a server you own. You
              can also start threads in on-demand cloud sandboxes in your own

              you pay nothing extra to bb.
