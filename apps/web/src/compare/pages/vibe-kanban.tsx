            <p>
              Its maker, bloop,{" "}
              <a href="https://www.vibekanban.com/blog/shutdown">shut down</a>{" "}
              in April 2026 and said it would remove cloud projects, issues, and
              organizations. The open-source app continues as a community
              project, but version 0.1.44 turned off Projects for everyone, and
              there hasn’t been a release since. Local workspaces still run.

          ),
        },
        {
          question: "What’s the difference between bb and Vibe Kanban?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Both run Claude Code, Codex, and other coding agents in Git
              worktrees, and both are free and open source. Vibe Kanban retired
              its board in 0.1.44; bb’s Tasks plugin keeps yours on your machine
              with no sign-in. bb is actively developed, with a release every
              week.
            </p>
          ),
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need an account to use bb?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              No. bb runs on your computer, and your tasks stay in its local
              database. Signing in is optional and only turns on bb’s hosted
              extras, like remote access.
            </p>
          ),
        },
        {
          question: "Can I bring my Vibe Kanban tasks and worktrees?",
          answer: (
            <p>
              Yes. Ask bb to do it. Your branches and worktrees are plain Git on
              your machine, so a bb agent can add the repo and open each
              worktree as a thread. If you exported your Vibe Kanban issues, it
              can turn each one into a task on your board.{" "}
