    question: "I don't see Annotate elements",
    answer: (
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use the bb desktop app. Annotations only work in a{" "}
          <strong>Browser</strong> tab there, not in the web app or the live
          preview in a thread.
        </li>
        <li>
          In <strong>Plugins</strong>, open <strong>Agent Annotations</strong>{" "}

    question: "The browser won't start",

      <ol>
        <li>
          Check that the machine is connected in{" "}
          <Ui icon="settings">Settings → Machines</Ui>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first run installs the browser tools on that machine, so it needs
          network access and npm. A fresh browser also needs Chrome or Chromium
          installed there.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a Browser tab, keep the bb desktop app open, then ask again.
        </li>
      </ol>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "The site still asks me to sign in",
    answer: (
      <ol>
        <li>
          A fresh browser starts signed out. Ask your agent to use a Browser tab
          instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Import from <Ui icon="settings">Settings → Browser</Ui> again.
          Importing copies your logins once, so newer logins don't carry over.
        </li>
        <li>
          Still signed out? Sign in once in a Browser tab. It stays signed in.
        </li>

        <li>
          Quit that browser completely, then choose <strong>Recheck</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          For Safari, choose <strong>Grant access…</strong> and turn on Full
          Disk Access for bb. Chrome may ask for Keychain access; allow it.
        </li>

          Choose <strong>Refresh</strong> to look for browsers again.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "The live preview says Ended",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Your agent closed its browser, or it sat unused for five minutes. The
        thread keeps the last view. Ask your agent to open it again.

export const BROWSER_FAQ: GuideFaq[] = [
  AGENTS_FAQ,
  {
    question: "Do I need the desktop app?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Not for a fresh browser: your agent can open Chrome on any connected Mac
        or Linux machine, and you watch it in the thread. Browser tabs, your
        logins, and annotations need the desktop app.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I stop the agent or step in?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes. A Browser tab shows a bar while your agent controls it. Choose{" "}
        <strong>Take over</strong> to click and type yourself, like to enter a
        sign-in code, or <strong>Stop</strong> to end its control.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can my agent see my passwords?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No. bb imports your logins, not your saved passwords, so your agent
        opens sites already signed in without seeing a password. Your logins
        stay in bb's Browser on this computer, and the prompt from{" "}
        <strong>Copy for agent</strong> tells your agent never to read or print
        them.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can the browser run on a different computer?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes. Ask for the browser on the machine you want. There,{" "}
        <code>localhost</code> means that computer, so use an address it can
        reach.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Does it need macOS Automation permission?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No. Browser Automation talks to Chrome and bb's Browser directly, so it
        doesn't need Accessibility or Automation permission.
      </p>
    ),
  },
