  `Run a dev server for each branch on a remote bb machine, and share each one at its own getbb.app link.
Guide: https://getbb.app/guides/remote-dev-servers

If a step fails, stop and tell me what you saw. Don't open firewall ports, send localhost links, or share ports I didn't ask for. Leave work in progress alone: don't stash, reset, or switch branches in any folder.

1. Check what's needed first. If \`bb connect status\` shows remote access off, ask me to turn on bb connect in Settings. If \`bb machine list\` doesn't show the machine, run \`bb terminal create --thread "$BB_THREAD_ID" --title "Add machine" --command "bb machine create --provider manual"\`, take the install command from \`bb terminal output <terminal-id>\`, and run it on the machine over SSH, or send it to me if you can't reach it. If the machine is a container dev environment without systemd, like Codespaces, Coder, Ona, Cloud Workstations, or an in-house container, tell me to raise its idle timeout and to add \`curl -sSL <my bb address>/install.sh | sh -s -- --start --host-id <machine-id>\` to its startup script, so bb comes back when it restarts.
2. Each server runs from what's committed on its branch. If a branch I named has uncommitted or unpushed changes, here or in my checkout, tell me and ask whether to commit and push them first or skip that branch.
3. If \`bb project show "$BB_PROJECT_ID"\` has no source on the machine, run \`bb project source add "$BB_PROJECT_ID" --path <checkout> --machine <machine>\` for my existing checkout, or \`bb project source add "$BB_PROJECT_ID" --clone --machine <machine>\` if there isn't one.
4. For each branch, start a thread on the machine that starts its own server, all at once:
   bb thread spawn --json --project "$BB_PROJECT_ID" --machine <machine> --new-environment worktree --base-branch <origin/branch, or the local branch if there's no remote> --title "<branch>" --prompt "Install dependencies if they're missing, then start this branch's dev server. Pick a free port, save it as WEB_PORT in .env.local (don't commit it), and run <dev server command> with HOST=127.0.0.1 and PORT set to that port in a bb terminal titled Dev server. Don't change the app's code. Reply with the port once it's listening, or with the error."
5. Wait for each thread with \`bb thread wait\` and read its port with \`bb thread output\`.
6. Share each port with \`bb connect expose <port> --host <machine>\`, and check that \`bb connect shares --host <machine>\` lists them all.

Reply with a table of branch, port, and link. ${skillOffer("preview-branches", "my machine and dev server command")}`,
);

const SETUP_SCRIPT = `#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
pnpm install
free_port() { node -e 'const s=require("net").createServer().listen(0,"127.0.0.1",()=>{console.log(s.address().port);s.close()})'; }

          Yes. Your machines connect out to bb, so you don't open any ports. If

            Yes, including Ona, Google Cloud Workstations, Microsoft Dev Box,
