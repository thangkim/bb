  `Build the task, have Codex review it in its own thread, talk it through with Codex. One review round, then stop.
Guide: https://getbb.app/guides/claude-code-and-codex-together

Do these steps in order and run each check. If a check fails, stop and tell me what you saw. Don't push, open a pull request, or merge unless I ask.

If you aren't Claude Code, tell me to paste this into a Claude Code thread instead, and stop.

1. Get a branch. If you're on the repo's default branch, create a new branch first. Run \`BASE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)\` and keep the value.
   Check: \`git branch --show-current\` isn't the default branch.

2. Build the task and commit your work.
   Check: \`git status\` is clean and \`git log -1\` shows your commit.

3. Start Codex as the reviewer in its own thread, in this worktree:
   bb thread spawn --json --project "$BB_PROJECT_ID" --environment "$BB_ENVIRONMENT_ID" --parent-self --provider codex --title "<task>" --prompt "Task: <task>. Review git diff <BASE>..HEAD read-only. Don't edit files or commit. List each issue as serious or minor, with file and line."
   Check: the spawn returns a thread ID. If Codex fails to start, stop and ask me to sign in to Codex on this computer.

4. Wait for the review and read it:
   bb thread wait <codex-thread-id>
   bb thread output <codex-thread-id>
   Check: the output lists issues or says there are none. If bb later tells you the reviewer completed, just repeat your final report.

5. Fix every serious issue and commit. If a finding is unclear, ask first: bb thread tell <codex-thread-id> "<your question>", then read the answer with bb thread wait and bb thread output. Don't ask for a second review.
   Check: \`git status\` is clean and each serious issue has a fix.

6. Stop. Leave the reviewer's thread open so I can read it; don't archive it.

Reply with what you built, what the review found, what you fixed, and what's left for me. ${skillOffer("build-and-review", "the reviewer")}`,
