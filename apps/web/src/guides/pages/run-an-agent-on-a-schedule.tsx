  `Set up a bb automation for this project and test it once.
Guide: https://getbb.app/guides/run-an-agent-on-a-schedule

Default Job: morning issue triage on weekdays at 9am, with reports in one thread. Ask for my timezone. Pass --project $BB_PROJECT_ID to every bb automation command. If a step fails, stop and tell me the error.

1. Read \`bb automation create --help\`. Turn on the Automations plugin if \`bb plugin list\` shows it's off. For an agent job, pick a model from \`bb provider models <provider> --json\`.
2. If \`bb automation list\` already has this job, reuse it and skip to step 4.
3. Create it paused: \`bb automation create --name '<name>' --disabled\` with \`--cron '<expression>' --timezone <IANA zone>\` or \`--at <ISO time>\`, plus either:
   - Agent: \`--prompt '<prompt>' --provider <provider> --model <model> --permission-mode auto\`. For reports in one thread, start that thread with \`bb thread spawn\` and add \`--target-thread <its ID>\`. For code changes, add \`--new-environment worktree\` and tell it not to push.
   - Script: \`--script-file <path>\`. It starts an agent with \`"$BB_CLI" thread spawn\` only when there's work, and prints nothing otherwise.
4. Test it with \`bb automation run <id>\`, then read the run's thread or output. If it doesn't do the job, leave it paused and tell me why.
5. Turn it on with \`bb automation resume <id>\`, asking me first for a one-time job. If Notifications is yes, send \`bb push-notifications test web\` and ask me to confirm it arrived.

Reply with the automation ID, schedule, next run, and what the test produced.`,

          That's the default. Ask your agent to post every run to one thread,

          reports only.

          A script that exits without printing anything counts as skipped. Have
          it print a short result when there's something to report. A script
          that exits with an error or times out shows as failed; open the run to

          An agent automation sends a prompt to the agent and model you pick,
          and uses your plan each run. A script runs on the bb server with no
          model, so it's free to run often, and it can start agent threads when
          it finds work.
