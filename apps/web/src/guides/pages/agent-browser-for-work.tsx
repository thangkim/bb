Guide: https://getbb.app/guides/agent-browser-for-work

Do every step below, with a Check after each step. Stop if a check fails and tell me what failed.

1. Set up browser access. Run bb plugin list. Browser Automation isn't installed by default: install it with bb plugin install browser-automation --yes if it's missing, or enable it with bb plugin enable browser-automation if it's off. Agent Annotations is built in but off: enable it with bb plugin enable agent-annotations. Then read bb guide browser and bb browser-automation --help.
   Check: both plugins are running.

2. Open a browser. Find the computer running the bb desktop app with bb machine list, then run bb browser instances --host <desktop-host-id> --json. If a desktop instance is connected, open a Browser tab there so I can watch and my sign-ins work:
   bb browser-automation open --backend desktop --machine <desktop-host-id> --desktop <instance-id> --json
   If no desktop instance is connected and Logins lists any site, stop and tell me signed-in sites need the bb desktop app open. Otherwise open headless Chrome on this thread's machine:
   bb browser-automation open --backend local --headless --machine <host-id> --json
   Keep the returned session ID. Emit the returned previewDirective once if present.
   Check: the first page loads. For a signed-in site, confirm the expected account is signed in. If it isn't, stop and ask me to sign in once in a Browser tab, or to import my sign-ins in Settings → Browser. Never read or print cookie values.

3. Do the task. Take a fresh snapshot before each action and use its element references. Read pages instead of guessing, and keep a list of the sources you used. If a page doesn't state a number, say so instead of filling it in from memory. Don't buy anything, send messages, submit forms that commit me to something, or change account settings unless I asked for exactly that; stop and ask first.
   Check: you have the information or result I asked for, with the page each fact came from.

4. Report and leave the tab for feedback. If you used a desktop Browser tab, stop controlling it with bb browser-automation stop <session-id> so it stays open on the most relevant page, and tell me I can choose Annotate elements to point at anything to change or dig into. If you used headless Chrome, close it with bb browser-automation close <session-id> and give me the page URLs instead.
   Check: reply with the result in the format from my Bring back answer (by default, a table with a source per row), a source link for each fact, screenshots of anything I should look at, and what you couldn't do.

If it's a task I'll want again, offer to save these steps as a bb skill in .bb/skills/<short-name>/SKILL.md with my answers filled in, or as a bb automation if it should run on a schedule.`,
