  `Get this bb ready for me to use from my phone.
Guide: https://getbb.app/guides/work-from-anywhere

Do these steps in order and run each check. If a check fails, stop and tell me what you saw. Don't change any other settings.

1. Check the account: run \`bb account status\`.
   Check: it shows a signed-in getbb.app account. If not, run \`bb account login\`, send me the link and code it prints, and ask me to approve it and claim a handle, then tell you "done". Then run \`bb account status\` again.

2. Check remote access: run \`bb connect status\`.
   Check: it shows connected and an https://<handle>.getbb.app address. If remote access is off, run \`bb connect on\` and check again.

3. Only if "Keep this computer awake" is yes: run \`bb keep-awake enable\`, then \`bb keep-awake status\`.
   Check: it shows Keep Awake enabled. If the command isn't found, run \`bb plugin enable keep-awake\` and try again.

4. Set up the phone app: tell me to open Settings → Mobile in bb on this computer, install the app for my phone (TestFlight for iPhone, the Android download for Android), choose Add mobile device, and scan the code in the app. If Notifications is yes, tell me to allow them when the app asks. Wait until I say "done", then run \`bb push-notifications list\`.
   Check: my phone shows up in the list.

Reply with my getbb.app address (I can also open it in any browser), whether my phone is connected, and whether Keep Awake is on. Remind me that closing a laptop's lid still puts it to sleep.`,

          The bb app for iPhone or Android, from Settings → Mobile. You can also

      question: "How do my devices connect?",
      answer: (
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The server</strong> runs on one computer, usually the first
            one you set bb up on. It keeps your threads, settings, and history.
            While it's asleep or off, nothing can reach bb.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Machines</strong> are the computers that run agents. Each
            one connects to the server. The server's own computer is a machine
            too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apps</strong>, like the desktop app, the mobile app, and
            your getbb.app address, all open the same server. Your agents run on
            machines, not in the app you're looking at.
          </li>
        </ul>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Which of my computers is the server?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Open <Ui icon="settings">Settings → Machines</Ui>. The server's
          computer has a server badge.

    },
    {
      question: "I set up bb on two computers. Why don't they share threads?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Each setup runs its own server. To use one bb everywhere, keep the
          server on the computer that stays on, and add the other one from{" "}
          <Ui icon="settings">Settings → Machines</Ui>. New threads can then run
          on either computer.

      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Does quitting the desktop app stop my agents?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          On the server's computer, yes. Agents, automations, and remote access
          stop until you open it again. On a Mac, closing the window keeps bb
          running.

    {
      question: "Do my terminal sessions show up?",

          No. bb runs your signed-in agents, like Claude Code and Codex, but it
          doesn't attach to sessions already open in a terminal. Start the work
          in bb.

      question: "Does bb store my traffic?",

        <p>
          No. bb connect doesn't store what you send or receive. Like a CDN, it
          caches public files that are marked cacheable, including ones from
          shared dev servers, and it logs a request's path when something
          errors.
