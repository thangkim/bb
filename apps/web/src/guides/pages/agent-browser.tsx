  `Use a real browser to check my app, click through the change, and show me screenshots.
Guide: https://getbb.app/guides/agent-browser

Do every step below, with a Check after each step. Stop if a check fails and tell me what failed. Don't commit, push, or deploy unless I ask.

1. Set up browser access. Run bb plugin list. Browser Automation isn't installed by default: install it with bb plugin install browser-automation --yes if it's missing, or enable it with bb plugin enable browser-automation if it's off. Agent Annotations is built in but off: enable it with bb plugin enable agent-annotations. Then read bb guide browser and bb browser-automation --help. Find this thread's machine with bb status --json and bb machine list.
   Check: both plugins are running and the chosen browser machine is connected.

2. Open the app.
   2a. If the App URL needs a dev server, start it with the project's documented command in a bb terminal in this environment, and check that the URL responds.
   2b. If Needs a sign-in is no, open headless Chrome on that machine:
   bb browser-automation open --backend local --headless --machine <host-id> --json
   2c. If Needs a sign-in is yes, use the desktop app's Browser instead: run bb browser instances --host <desktop-host-id> --json, select the intended connected desktop instance, then:
   bb browser-automation open --backend desktop --machine <desktop-host-id> --desktop <instance-id> --json
   Ask if the intended desktop instance is ambiguous. Localhost means the browser's machine; use a reachable app URL if it differs from the dev server's machine. Keep the returned session ID. Emit the returned previewDirective once if present. Use bb browser-automation run to get a named page, navigate, and snapshot it; follow bb guide browser for the script format. Each run times out after 30 seconds by default.
   Check: the page shows the intended app. For a signed-in flow, verify the expected account. If signed out, use bb browser import-sources with the selected host, instance, and generation to discover sources. Ask me which source/profile to use, then run bb browser import-cookies with those exact values. If the source browser needs quitting, an OS prompt needs my input, or login is still needed, stop with that specific next action. Never read or print cookie values. Import is desktop-only and doesn't populate headless sessions.

3. Verify the change. Take a fresh snapshot, click through the requested flow using its element references, and check the visible result. Check the console and the layout at each size in Screen sizes. Use bb browser-automation screenshot <session-id> --page <name> --json and inspect the returned images. Show the screenshots that matter in this thread as images; for another browser host, fetch them with bb file read. Fix failures within the requested change and recheck the affected flow.
   Check: the flow behaves as requested, the layout works at each size, and any console errors are explained. Report what you actually exercised and show the screenshots; don't call a screenshot alone a passing interaction test.

4. Leave the app ready for feedback. Close the automation session with bb browser-automation close <session-id> and keep the preview server running. In desktop bb, use bb browser create with the selected host, instance, generation, current thread, URL, and --reveal to leave a Browser tab open for annotations. If no desktop instance is connected, explain that element annotations require the desktop app and give me the app URL. Tell me to choose Annotate elements, click the element, write the change, and choose Add to prompt. When I send an annotation, use its element context to make the change and verify it in a new browser session.
   Check: the automation session is closed, the preview route still responds, and the feedback tab is open when desktop is available. Report the URL, terminal ID, browser machine, screenshots, and anything you couldn't verify.

      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes. Ask for the sizes you care about, like “desktop and iPhone.” The

          It's easiest. The agent starts the dev server in a terminal in the
