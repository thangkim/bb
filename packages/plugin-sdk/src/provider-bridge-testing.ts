/**
 * `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/provider-bridge/testing` — the published testing kit
 * for provider bridges.
 *
 * A bridge author needs three things to prove a bridge before shipping it,
 * none of which should require bb's private workspace packages:
 *
 * - the **conformance kit**: drive the bridge through the canonical protocol
 *   scenarios (JSON-RPC hygiene, the initialize handshake, a full session
 *   lifecycle, the event grammar) and get a pass/fail report per rule;
 * - the **delta assembler** itself, so a test can see the canonical
 *   `ThreadEvent`s the runtime would build from the bridge's `thread/delta`
 *   stream — the exact code the daemon runs, not a re-implementation;
 * - the **JSON-RPC harness** (capture stdout, send requests, await responses)
 *   and the **calibration normalizer** that makes whole-session goldens
 *   comparable across runs by interning minted ids;
 * - the **recorded-replay harness**: replay a recording bb made of the
 *   bridge (record mode, `BB_PROVIDER_BRIDGE_RECORD_DIR`) through the bridge
 *   again — the recorded runtime lane driven in, the recorded provider lanes
 *   played by the replay child the bridge spawns in place of its provider —
 *   and diff what it emits against the recording (`experimental_compareParity`),
 *   judge it with the recorded-cell conformance rules, or write the bridge's
 *   current output beside the recording (`experimental_rerecordCurrentBridgeLane`).
 *   Keyed by the caller's provider id and bridge module, never by a list of
 *   the providers bb ships.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic: nothing here imports a test runner. Curated by hand —
 * named exports only, never `export *`. Value exports carry the
 * `experimental_` prefix every new plugin API member ships with (see
 * docs/api_to_audit.md); types are unprefixed.
