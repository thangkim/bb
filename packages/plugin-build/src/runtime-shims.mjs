// Plain ESM on purpose: the build engine (build-plugin-app.ts) imports it as
// a module, and two generator scripts that run under bare `node` before any
// TypeScript is compiled read it by file path —
// packages/plugin-build/scripts/generate-runtime-export-manifest.mjs (the
// shims' static export lists) and
// packages/templates/scripts/generate-plugin-scaffold.mjs (the scaffold's
// type-only devDependencies). Keeping all three on this module is what makes
// "shimmed at runtime" and "declared for types" impossible to drift apart
// (#2072). The sibling runtime-shims.d.mts declares its shape for tsc.

/**
 * Runtime slot on `globalThis.__bbPluginRuntime` per shimmed specifier.
 * Shim policy (plugin design §5.5), two admission rules:
 *
 * 1. Singleton/global behavior — one React, the portaling radix families
 *    (shared dismissable-layer/focus/scroll-lock/aria-hidden world), sonner
 *    (`toast()` must reach the host toaster), vaul (mutates document.body
 *    styles), @pierre/diffs (its react FileDiff reads the host's
 *    WorkerPoolContextProvider — context identity requires one module copy —
 *    and sharing keeps shiki's grammars out of every plugin bundle) — plus
 *    the SDK surface itself.
 * 2. Host-resident libraries every plugin app would otherwise duplicate —
 *    tailwind-merge + clsx (the `cn()` pair every vendored component pulls
 *    in), class-variance-authority, and the shared-ui `Icon` (its hugeicons
 *    map is ~110 KB raw per copy). These have no singleton semantics; they
 *    are shimmed so a phone does not parse a dozen copies of the same code.
 *    A plugin gets the host's installed version, so its declared range must
 *    stay within the host's major (tailwind-merge ^3, clsx ^2, cva ^0.7).
 *    Rule 2 has a cost on the host side: exposing a namespace on the
 *    runtime object stops the app's bundler from tree-shaking that library
 *    out of the boot chunk, so it only admits libraries whose slot leaves
 *    the boot budget (apps/app/bundle-budget.json) intact. zod does not —
 *    the app uses a fraction of its exports and slotting the namespace
 *    added +193 KB raw / +33 KB brotli to the payload every phone downloads
 *    before first paint — so zod stays bundled per plugin.
 *
 * Everything else (non-portal radix, lucide-react, zod, form/calendar/chart
 * libs, hugeicons imported directly) bundles from the plugin's own
 * node_modules. Adding a slot here requires the matching host slot in
 * apps/app/src/lib/plugin-frontend.ts (installPluginRuntime); the export
 * manifest and the scaffold's type-only devDependencies follow automatically.
