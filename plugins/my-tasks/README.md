# My Tasks

My Tasks is a personal fork of bb's Tasks plugin: a Linear-style tracker inside bb for planning work, delegating it to
agents, and keeping the task record connected to the threads doing the work.
Work is organized as project → task → thread. Projects carry the workflow
status, priority, due date, description, and a progress bar (done tasks over
all tasks). Tasks are a checklist inside a project, done or not done, with
labels, due dates, Markdown comments, attachments, and the agent threads
working on them. There is also a full CLI.

## Install

Install My Tasks from this repository path. It runs alongside the bundled Tasks
plugin with its own id, storage, CLI, and message directive.

```sh
bb plugin build plugins/my-tasks
bb plugin install plugins/my-tasks
```

After edits, rebuild and run `bb plugin reload my-tasks`.

The plugin adds the My Tasks sidebar panel, the `bb my-tasks` command, and an agent
skill that teaches workers how to report progress back to tasks.

## Quick start

Install the plugin as shown above. Then use the `bb my-tasks` CLI
to create a tracker project. Link it to the bb project where delegated agents
will run:

```sh
bb my-tasks project create \
  --name "Product" \
  --prefix PROD \
  --link-bb-project proj_your_bb_project

bb my-tasks create \
  --project PROD \
  --title "Ship task delegation" \
  --description "Implement the flow and run focused validation." \
  --priority high

bb my-tasks list --project PROD
bb my-tasks show PROD-1
bb my-tasks preset list
bb my-tasks delegate PROD-1 --preset "GPT-5.6 · high"
```

When the CLI runs inside a linked bb project, `create` and `list` infer the
tracker project, so `--project` can be omitted. Task keys are case-insensitive
at the CLI boundary. You can also delegate from a task's **Delegate** menu,
choose or create presets under **Manage → Presets**, and type `@` in the bb
composer to send a task mention to an agent.

The comment composer shows a **Notify last responding agent** switch. When the
task has an agent reply, leave it on to send the new comment to the thread that
authored the latest reply, resuming that thread when it is idle. Turn it off to
keep the comment in Tasks only. If no agent has replied, the disabled control
says so explicitly. Agents and scripts can use the same behavior with
`bb my-tasks comment PROD-1 --body "New context" --notify`.
When run from a thread, the CLI preserves that agent thread and any explicit
`--author`; notification still targets the prior latest responder rather than
the newly recorded agent comment itself.

## CLI reference

Run `bb my-tasks --help` or `bb my-tasks <command> --help` for exact options; help
works at every level, lists each option's accepted values and limits, and exits 0. Unknown commands and options are rejected with the nearest real name, every
missing required value is reported in one error, and a failing invocation that
carries `--json` prints `{ "ok": false, "error": { "code", "message", "hint"? } }`
on stdout while stderr keeps the readable text. Add `--json` to commands when
another command or agent will consume the output.

`--project` takes a tracker project prefix or id such as `PROD`, never a bb
project id (`proj_...`); `bb my-tasks project list` shows both columns. Repeatable
options (`--label`, `--status`, `--priority`, `--add-label`, `--remove-label`)
also accept one comma-separated list. File paths (`--file`, `--attach`,
`--out`, `--description-file`, `--body-file`) resolve on the invoking machine:
inside an agent thread that is the thread's machine, otherwise the server's
machine; pass `--machine <id-or-name>` to target another enrolled machine.

Project statuses are `backlog`, `todo`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `done`,
and `canceled`. Task statuses are `todo` and `done`. Priorities are `urgent`,
`high`, `medium`, `low`, and `none`.

Task lists default to 100 rows and accept `--limit 1-500`. JSON output is
`{ tasks, nextCursor, limit }`; human output prints the continuation option
when another page exists. The cursor is opaque and tied to the filters, sort,
and current task-list revision. If tasks are added, removed, reordered, or
updated between requests—or label links/names, active task threads, or project
prefixes change—the old cursor is rejected. Restart from the first page rather
than traversing an inconsistent snapshot.

## Agents, delegation, and presets

Linking a Tasks project to a bb project enables delegation. Open a task, choose
**Delegate**, select a preset, and optionally add instructions. A preset
defines the provider, model, reasoning level, optional service tier, permission
mode, and reusable instructions. Presets are user-defined, so create the worker profiles your team
uses repeatedly before dispatching work.

Delegation creates a worker thread in the linked bb project, attaches that
thread to the task, and advances a `backlog` or `todo` project to
`in_progress`. The worker receives the task description, the project's
context and other tasks, attachments, recent comments, preset instructions,
and a report-back contract. Its installed skill tells it to inspect the task,
leave substantive milestone comments, attach artifacts, and mark the task done
when its criteria are met.

In the app, every task row has **New thread** (pick a preset) and **Attach
thread** (search your bb threads). Clicking a thread opens it in a split pane.

If work begins outside the Delegate action, the agent can associate its current
thread with `bb my-tasks attach KEY`. The inverse is `bb my-tasks detach KEY
[--thread <id>]`, and each thread card on the task page has a detach control;
use either to drop a thread that died or moved on to other work. The task
page and `bb my-tasks threads` list live threads before completed or failed ones,
newest first.

## Task mentions

Type `@` in the bb composer and select **Tasks** to search by task key or title.
Sending the mention gives the agent the task's description, done state,
priority, labels, the project's other tasks, attachments, recent comments, attached threads, and CLI
action contract as context. Tasks linked to the current bb project rank first.

Inside a task description or comment, `@` also inserts a task pill. These
references are stored in Markdown as `[PROD-1](bbtask://PROD-1)`, so they remain
portable in task content.

Mentioning a task key such as `PROD-1` in an agent request also activates the
Tasks skill, which directs the worker to read and update the tracked task.

## Known limitations

- The **Auto** delegation preset is deferred; choose an explicit preset.
- List filters are local UI state and are not persisted in the URL.

## Fast follow

- Batch task-list enrichment for comments and attached-thread state.
- Add notifications and an inbox for task activity.
- Add a command palette entry for Tasks to cmd-K.
