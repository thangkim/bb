# Codex provider

Codex supports structured plan requests, editing and rerunning eligible messages,
and compaction through the corresponding core `bb thread` commands.
`bb thread clear-goal <id>` clears its durable active Goal and waits for provider
confirmation. Inspect the thread before recovery actions.

Codex questions from `request_user_input` pause the turn until answered.
Questions from `request_user_input_async` do not pause it: the plugin opens a
question card for each one that stays open for up to an hour after the turn
ends. Submitting sends the answer to the thread as a message
(steering an active turn or starting a new one); dismissing sends nothing.
From the CLI, find it with `bb thread interactions list <thread>` and answer
with `bb thread interactions respond <interactionId> <thread> --value
'{"answers":{"question-1":{"selected":["option-2"]}}}'`. Questions and options
are numbered from 1 in order; use `"freeText"` for a typed answer.

Unlisted model IDs are accepted by this provider; acceptance does not establish
account access. Inspect models on the actual execution host with
`bb provider models codex` using the machine or environment selector.

Service tiers are `default`, `fast`, and `ultrafast`. Codex reports the tiers
each model accepts for the signed-in account, so the model picker and
`bb provider models codex` (Service tiers column, `supportedServiceTiers` in
`--json`) list Ultrafast only for eligible models and accounts. Pass the id to
`--service-tier` on `bb thread spawn` or `bb thread tell`; bb sends an explicit
tier to Codex as given. When the model does not list it, Codex runs the turn
at its default tier and the thread shows its warning that the tier "is not
advertised as supported" and was omitted.

Daybreak is a session option with the id `daybreak`, offered only when the
signed-in account's model list advertises a Daybreak program. Turn it on in the
model picker, with `bb thread spawn --option daybreak=true`, or on an existing
thread with `bb thread options --set daybreak=true`; it applies from the next
turn and Codex stores the choice on its own thread. With it on, each turn asks
for the selected model's Daybreak program (blue when the model lists it,
otherwise red); once it has been turned off, each turn asks for the standard
program. A thread where Daybreak was never set sends no program and leaves the
choice to Codex.
`bb provider models codex` lists the option, and `--json` shows per model
whether it runs with Daybreak, without it, or both (`sessionOptions`, where
`fixed: true` means only the listed value). A model that cannot run in the
current state is disabled in the picker. The `gpt-daybreak-*-latest` alias
models leave the main list when the switch is available and stay selectable
only on threads that already use them.

Use the core CLI skill for command syntax and official Codex guidance for
upstream product behavior.
