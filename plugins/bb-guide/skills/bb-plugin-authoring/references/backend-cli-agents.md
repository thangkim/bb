# CLI, input, agents, and AI services

### bb.cli — an agent-facing `bb` subcommand

One top-level command per plugin; a second `register` in one factory
execution is rejected.
Users and agents run `bb <name> …` like any core command; the bb CLI
proxies it to the server, where `run` executes. Core collisions log an
activation warning and appear in `bb plugin list` as `bb plugin run <id>`.

```ts
bb.cli.register({
  name: "weather", // lowercase [a-z0-9-]+; core collisions use bb plugin run <id>
  summary: "Weather lookups",
  commands: [
    // help/skill metadata only; parsing argv is yours
    {
      name: "today",
      summary: "Today's weather",
      usage: "bb weather today <city>",
    },
  ],
  async run(argv, ctx) {
    // argv EXCLUDES the command name: `bb weather today sf` → argv = ["today", "sf"]
    // ctx: { cwd?, threadId?, projectId?, signal }
    return { exitCode: 0, stdout: "sunny" }; // { exitCode, stdout?, stderr? }
  },
});
```

Prefer declaring the command instead of parsing `argv` by hand.
`defineCli` builds the same registration from a spec and gives
every command the behavior agents rely on: `--help` at every level with exit
0, `unknown option '--x' (Did you mean --y?)`, every missing required option
in one error, typed value errors, and with `--json` a
`{"ok": false, "error": {"code", "message", "hint"}}` envelope on stdout while
stderr keeps the readable text. Hand-written parsers have silently ignored
unknown flags and lost user data.

```ts
import { PluginCliError, cliCommand, defineCli } from "@get-bb/plugin-sdk";

bb.cli.register(
  defineCli({
    name: "weather",
    summary: "Weather lookups",
    commands: {
      today: cliCommand({
        summary: "Today's weather",
        positionals: [
          { name: "city", description: "City name", required: true },
        ],
        options: {
          units: {
            type: "enum",
            values: ["metric", "imperial"],
            default: "metric",
            aliases: ["unit"],
            description: "Units for temperatures",
          },
          timeout: {
            type: "duration",
            defaultUnit: "s",
            description: "How long to wait for the forecast service",
          },
          json: { type: "boolean", description: "Emit machine-readable JSON" },
        },
        async run(input, ctx) {
          const forecast = await lookup(
            input.positionals.city,
            input.options.units,
          );
          if (forecast === null) {
            throw new PluginCliError(
              `no forecast for ${input.positionals.city}`,
              {
                code: "forecast_not_found",
                hint: "Run `bb weather cities` to list supported cities.",
              },
            );
          }
          return { exitCode: 0, stdout: forecast };
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
);
```

Command keys are invocation paths, so `"account add"` declares
`bb weather account add`. Put every spelling an agent might guess in an
option's hidden `aliases`, state limits in each `description` because they
show in `--help`, and express "exactly one of" and "X requires Y" with
`constraints`. Keep a required ID strict, but when `ctx.projectId` or
`ctx.threadId` holds the value, throw an `PluginCliError` whose `hint`
prints the exact flag to add. A registration built this way sets
`rendersHelp`, so `bb weather today --help` reaches the plugin and
prints its full option help; a hand-written `run` leaves that unset and the
`bb` CLI answers `--help` from the `commands[].usage` line without calling
the plugin.

Agents discover plugin commands through the server-generated
`plugin-commands` skill, which lists each command's `summary` and the
`commands` usage lines — fill both in. Combined stdout and stderr must fit
`PLUGIN_CLI_OUTPUT_MAX_BYTES` from `@get-bb/plugin-sdk` (1,048,576 UTF-8 bytes).
The host rejects a larger result atomically as `plugin_cli_output_too_large`;
it never clips it. Page growing collections, cap verbose fields, and use
file/streaming commands for large content. Caveat: under the workspace
sandbox (Accept Edits / Approve for me), Claude's macOS sandbox permits
loopback, so `bb` CLI calls (including plugin commands) work sandboxed;
Linux and other provider sandboxes may still block loopback, in which case
those calls need escalation approval.

**Multi-machine rule: `run` executes on the server, so a path argument names
a file on the INVOKING machine, not on `run`'s filesystem.** Never open a
`ctx.cwd`-relative or user-supplied path with `node:fs` — on an enrolled
remote machine that silently reads or writes the wrong host's disk. Instead
resolve the invoking host (`ctx.threadId` → `bb.sdk.threads.get` →
`environmentId` → `bb.sdk.environments.get(...).hostId`, with an explicit
`--machine`-style flag as the no-thread escape hatch) and do all such file I/O
through `bb.sdk.files` with that `hostId`. An omitted SDK `hostId` targets the
server machine (`primaryHostId`), which can be an enrolled remote machine. Reference
implementations: the docs plugin's pull/push sync and the
tasks plugin's attachment commands. `node:fs` remains correct for genuinely
server-local data such as files under the plugin's own data directory.

### bb.ui.requestInput — show a form in the thread composer

Use `bb.ui.requestInput({ threadId, rendererId, title, payload, timeoutMs? },
{ signal? })` for sensitive or structured user input. Pair `rendererId` with a
frontend `pendingInteraction` slot. The promise resolves to
`{ outcome: "submitted", value }` or `{ outcome: "cancelled", reason }`.
Payloads and responses are JSON values capped at 64 KiB.

Two optional fields control the form's timeline row:

- `presentation: PluginRowPresentation` sets labels, icon, and styling.
  Defaults are "Waiting for <title>" / "Submitted <title>" and the plugin's
  branding glyph.
- `describeSubmission(value)` returns a `PluginInteractionDescription` with
  optional `title`, Markdown `detail`, and `payload`. The payload goes to the
  plugin's `experimental_timelineRenderer` for `"<pluginId>/<rendererId>"`.
  Only this description is saved as submission history; omit secrets.
  The callback runs once per submission, never on cancellation. If it throws
  or exceeds two seconds, the row keeps its completed label.

Inside a tool's `execute`, opening a form returns a waiting notice to the
agent while the plugin continues awaiting the answer. BB delivers the tool's
eventual result separately: success resumes an active or idle agent; errors
only reach an active agent.

Pass `ctx.signal` to cancel the form with its caller. For CLI commands,
disconnection cancels it. For tools, request cancellation aborts the signal
until a form opens; afterward, only thread stop/delete or plugin disposal
aborts it. For tools that never open a form, request cancellation still aborts
`ctx.signal`.

### bb.agents — native tools and conditional session configuration

To give agents standing knowledge (conventions, workflows), ship a
`skills/` directory. For schema'd capabilities, register a native tool.
For a short, per-resolution instruction block (e.g. "the user is viewing
bb remotely — share tunnel URLs"), use `contributeInstructions`:

```ts
import { z } from "zod"; // runtime import — declare zod as a plugin dependency
bb.agents.registerTool({
  name: "docs_search", // [a-zA-Z0-9_-]+, unique ACROSS plugins
  description: "Search the bundled docs.",
  instructions: "Prefer docs_search over guessing conventions.", // optional, appended to thread instructions
  // Optional row presentation (grammar v3). Without it, BB shows its normal
  // tool name and the plugin's branding glyph. Errors/interruptions keep
  // that standard rendering so the failing tool remains identifiable.
  presentation: {
    label: {
      pending: "Searching bundled docs",
      completed: "Searched bundled docs",
    },
  },
  parameters: z.object({ query: z.string().min(1) }),
  async execute({ query }, { threadId, projectId, signal }) {
    return excerpts.join("\n"); // or { content: [{ type: "text", text }], isError? }
  },
});

// All tools and manifest skills are static registrations. configure() only
// selects this plugin's own ids when BB resolves a thread/session config.
bb.agents.configure((context) => ({
  tools: context.provider.id === "codex" ? ["docs_search"] : [],
  skills: context.project.kind === "standard" ? ["repo-conventions"] : [],
  instructions: `Docs selection resolved for ${context.project.name}.`,
}));

// Dynamic section evaluated at thread.start / turn.submit (sync, fast).
// Return null to contribute nothing for that resolution. Duplicate factory
// registrations are rejected. Output is capped at 4096
// characters; a throw is logged and contributes nothing. Side-chat
// threads never receive plugin instructions.
bb.agents.contributeInstructions(({ threadId, projectId }) => {
  if (!shouldAdviseRemoteUrls()) return null;
  return "The user is viewing bb remotely — share tunnel URLs, not localhost.";
});
```

`parameters` is a zod schema (zod 4; validated per call — bad model args
become a tool error, not a plugin crash) or a plain JSON-schema object
(execute then receives raw `unknown`). Tool-set changes apply on the NEXT
session start, not mid-session. Name collisions: within one factory execution
duplicate registrations are rejected; across plugins the earlier plugin wins
and yours is dropped with the reason in your status detail.

`presentation` is optional: `label` supplies static, concise
titles for the pending and completed states (each limited to 80 characters;
a longer label rejects the registration), `icon` a host glyph name or one of
this plugin's declared icons as `{ glyph: "<pluginId>/<name>" }` (see
`bb.branding.experimental_icons`; another plugin's id or an undeclared name
rejects the registration), `suppress` collapses low-value rows by default,
and `tint` accents the row per theme. The server resolves one full presentation per tool and the
provider bridge stamps it on every call's timeline row (the row's glyph is
checked at ingest against this plugin's declared icons, whichever plugin
provides the thread); it is not a frontend
bundle hook. A state with no label — error, interrupted, or awaiting
approval — falls back to BB's standard `Running tool …` / `Ran tool …`
wording, as does omitting the field entirely.

`contributeInstructions` is synchronous. It runs on `thread.start` and
`turn.submit`, so keep it fast. Prefer `skills/` for standing knowledge. Use
this callback only when the text must reflect live plugin state.

Ordering is standard BB instructions, selected tools' static snippets,
`contributeInstructions` output, `configure` dynamic instructions, data-dir
user instructions, then workspace instructions. Tool snippets are rejected at
registration above 4096 characters; each legacy/dynamic callback contribution
is truncated to 4096 characters.

`configure` is also synchronous and may be registered only once per factory
execution. Its context has required, plain-data `thread`, `project`,
`environment`, `host`, and `provider` objects. The `provider` object includes
`id`, `model`, and declared capabilities. The `origin` object has `kind` and
`pluginId`; genuinely absent values are `null`, not omitted. A side chat has
`origin: { kind: "fork", pluginId: "side-chat" }`. `tools` names and `skills`
frontmatter names may select only this plugin's static registrations. A
`tools` entry may instead be
`{ name, parameters }` to override the parameter schema advertised to the
provider for that resolution only — `parameters` must be a JSON-serializable
JSON-schema object with root `type: "object"`, at most 128 KiB serialized, and
should only narrow what the registered schema accepts, since execution-side
validation still runs the registered parameters. Unknown or duplicate ids,
malformed output, an invalid override, more than 256 ids in either array, or a
throwing callback fail closed for that plugin only. Dynamic `instructions` are
truncated to 4096 characters.

Resolution happens for `thread.start` and `turn.submit`. A selected tool set
takes effect only when the provider session is next started/resumed; BB never
hot-mutates a running provider session. Instructions follow the same rule: a
live provider session keeps the instructions it was constructed with, and
changed instructions apply when the session is next constructed.
Skill catalog changes follow the daemon's established runtime policy. A busy
environment keeps its current staged catalog until a safe relaunch. Side chats
also evaluate `configure`; inspect `origin` to identify them. Returned tools,
skills, and dynamic instructions use the same boundaries. The legacy
`contributeInstructions` also runs for side chats, but its legacy context has
only `threadId` and `projectId`. Use `configure` when the contribution must
inspect the side-chat origin.

### bb.experimental_aiServices — titles, commit messages, and voice

bb's helper tasks are served by plugins: thread titles (branch names follow the
title), commit messages, and voice transcripts. Register plain functions in
`server.ts`. The user picks a service per task in Settings → AI services or
with `bb settings ai-services set <task> <service-id>`:

```ts
bb.experimental_aiServices.register({
  id: "acme",
  displayName: "Acme AI",
  complete: async (prompt, { signal }) => {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.acme.test/v1/chat/completions", {
      method: "POST",
      signal,
      headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }] }),
    });
    const body = await response.json();
    return body.choices[0].message.content;
  },
  transcribe: async (audio, { signal, hint }) =>
    transcribeWithAcme(audio, hint, signal),
  status: async () =>
    apiKey ? { ready: true } : { ready: false, message: "Add an API key" },
});
```

- `complete(prompt, { signal })` returns the model's text. bb writes the
  prompt and cleans the reply (think blocks, quotes, labels, extra lines), so
  return the text as-is. Declared services appear for titles and commits.
- `transcribe(audio: File, { signal, hint })` returns a transcript. `hint` is
  vocabulary text or `null`. Declared services appear for voice input.
- `status()` is optional. Its message shows beside the service in the picker.
  A service that is not ready is skipped by Automatic and hides the
  microphone. bb caches the result for about 10 seconds.
- The plugin owns everything behind the function: model, API, retries. Failure
  is a rejected promise. bb aborts `signal` after 5 seconds for text and 10
  seconds for voice.
- The functions run in the server process. To use host-local state (a login
  file, a local model), call your own `bb.host` entry through
  `bb.hosts.experimental_client`, as the Codex plugin does.
- Automatic only uses services bb ships. A third-party service receives text
  only after the user selects it.
- bb identifies a service by plugin id and service id, so ids only need to be
  unique within your plugin; registering one id twice fails your plugin's
  load. `automatic` and `off` are reserved.
