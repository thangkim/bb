# Frontend registration and major surfaces

## Frontend (`bb.app` entry)

`app.tsx` default-exports `definePluginApp` from `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app`.
React and the SDK are **never bundled** — `bb plugin build` shims them to
the host's shared runtime, so the bundle only works inside bb.

```tsx
import {
  definePluginApp,
  useRpc,
  useRealtime,
  useRealtimeConnectionState,
  useSettings,
  useBbContext,
  useBbNavigate,
  experimental_FileLink as FileLink,
  UrlLink as UrlLink,
  useComposer,
} from "@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app";
import { toast } from "sonner"; // shimmed to the host toaster
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // vendored source YOU own
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "@/components/ui/dialog";

export default definePluginApp((app) => {
  app.contentScripts.register({
    id: "editor-enhancement",
    mount({ pluginId, generation, signal }) {
      const onKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
        // Ordinary trusted, same-origin DOM behavior.
      };
      document.addEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown, { signal });
      return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown);
    },
  });

    id: "issues",
    title: "Open issues",
    component: IssuesSection,

  app.slots.navPanel({

    icon: "Columns",
    path: "board",
    component: Board,
    fixedTabs: [
      {
        panelId: "board",
        id: "navigation",
        title: "Navigation",
        icon: "PanelRight",
        component: BoardNavigation,
        layout: "flush",
      },
    ],
    experimental_sidebarAccessory: OpenIssueCount,
  });
  app.slots.threadPanelAction({

        run: ({ composer }) =>

              from: match.index,
              to: match.index + match[0].length,
            })),
        },
      ],
    },
  });
  app.slots.pendingInteraction({
    id: "credentials",
    component: CredentialForm,
  });

  });
  app.slots.messageDirective({ id: "inline-vis", component: InlineVis });
  app.slots.experimental_threadList({
    id: "inbox",
    title: "Inbox",
    description: "One flat list, newest thread on top.",
    component: InboxList,
  });
});
```

### A control in the thread header

`app.slots.experimental_threadHeaderAction` renders a component in the thread
header's action row. Use it for live plugin state.

```tsx
app.slots.experimental_threadHeaderAction({
  id: "subagents",
  title: "Subagents",
  component: ({ threadId, projectId, isCompactViewport }) => { ... },
});
```

The row is a 48px chrome row with 28px controls. Render one inline control.
Put taller content in a portalled popover. The host limits the layout box, but
it does not clip painted overflow. `title`
names the host's wrapper region — your icon-only button still needs its own
accessible name. A split layout renders one header
per pane, so your component mounts once per visible thread — keep per-thread
state in the component, never in a module-level singleton.

A common pairing with a replaced sidebar: hide child threads from the list and
surface them here instead, filtering `experimental_useSidebarThreads()` by
`parentThreadId === threadId`.

Set `placement: "title"` to render the component right after the thread title,
before the thread actions menu, instead of in the action row. Use it for a
short label that describes the thread, such as the task it belongs to.
### An action in every thread menu

`app.slots.experimental_threadAction` adds an entry to the thread header's
actions menu, the sidebar row's menu, its right-click menu, the compact
long-press drawer, and, when the user picks it in Customize row actions, a
sidebar row's quick-action buttons. bb's own actions are registrations of the
same shape.

`useData` is a hook the host runs once for the whole app, never per row: read
your preferences or a realtime channel there. It receives `{ threadIds }`, the
sorted ids of every thread on screen or in an open menu; for per-thread state,
keep an id-keyed cache and fetch only the ids not in it, in one batch (for
example `useSdk().threads.experimental_listPluginMetadata({ threadIds })`).
`item` is pure: it gets `{ thread, data, sdk, navigate }` (your bound
`useSdk()` and `useBbNavigate()`) and returns the action for that thread, or
null to hide it. Menus and the quick-action picker sort registrations by
their static `group`, a separator between groups, then by `order`. Join one
of bb's groups through `experimental_THREAD_ACTION_GROUPS` or name your own. `choices` renders as a submenu, a drawer step with Back, or
a popover; the picked id reaches `run` as `value`. Set `detail` to show the
current value on a muted line under the label, and `choices.hint` for a footnote below the
choices.

```tsx
app.slots.experimental_threadAction({
  id: "notifications",
  title: "Notifications",
  icon: "Notification",
  group: experimental_THREAD_ACTION_GROUPS.settings,
  useData: ({ threadIds }) => useNotificationLevels(threadIds),
  item: ({ thread, data, sdk }) => ({
    label: "Notifications",
    detail: data.get(thread.id) === "muted" ? "Muted" : "All activity",
    icon: "Notification",
    choices: {
      items: [
        { id: "all", label: "All activity", selected: data.get(thread.id) === "all" },
        { id: "muted", label: "Muted", selected: data.get(thread.id) === "muted" },
      ],
    },
    run: ({ value }) => saveLevel(sdk, thread.id, value),
  }),
});
```

A replacement thread list renders bb's menus with
`experimental_ThreadActionsMenu` and `experimental_ThreadActionsContextMenu`,
passing its own rename editor as `requestRename` and list-only entries as
`inline` (`{ key, group, action }`). `trigger` is a function: spread the props
and ref it receives onto your button, or the menu never opens. `experimental_useThreadActions(thread, { keys })` returns bound
actions for quick-action buttons, and
`experimental_useThreadActionRegistrations()` lists every action's static
title and icon for a picker. Keys are `bb--core/<id>` and `<pluginId>/<id>`.

### A control in the Browser toolbar

`app.slots.experimental_browserToolbarAction` renders a component beside the
address bar of every built-in Browser tab. The component receives the owning
`threadId`, current `tabId`, top-level `url`, and `isCompactViewport` state.
Use these host-provided values to scope actions to the visible tab; do not infer
the active Browser from global state.

```tsx
app.slots.experimental_browserToolbarAction({
  id: "annotate",
  title: "Annotate page",
  component: ({ threadId, tabId, url, isCompactViewport }) => { ... },
});
```

Render a compact toolbar control and move larger UI into a host-owned panel or
portalled popover. `title` names the host wrapper; icon-only controls still need
their own accessible name. A component instance belongs to one Browser tab and
must release tab-scoped resources when it unmounts.

`experimental_page` scripts the tab's top-level document in the desktop app and
is `null` elsewhere. It does not take a CDP control lease, so no control banner
appears and agent automation can keep its debugger.

```tsx
component: ({ experimental_page: page }) => {
  useEffect(() => page?.onMessage((data) => console.log(data)), [page]);
  const pick = () =>
    page?.evaluate(
      "(document.addEventListener('click', (e) => bb.postMessage(e.target.tagName), { once: true }), true)",
    );
  ...
}
```

`evaluate(expression, { world })` awaits the expression and resolves its
JSON-cloned value. The default `isolated` world shares the DOM but not page
globals and binds `bb.postMessage(data)`; `onMessage` receives those values for
this plugin and tab. `world: "main"` runs beside page scripts (for example to
read framework state on DOM nodes) and binds `bb` to `null`. Anything installed
is lost when the document navigates; check again when `url` changes.

### Replacing the sidebar thread list

`app.slots.experimental_threadList` is the one **exclusive** slot: only one
list fills the sidebar's scroll area. Registering activates the replacement
while the plugin is enabled. If multiple plugins register one, the first in
deterministic slot order is active by default; removing it reveals the next.
The user can pin a specific provider under **Settings → Appearance →
Sidebar**. The choice is per client. bb ships its own list as the bundled
`thread-list` plugin; there is no separate built-in list.

Your component gets the scrolling list and nothing else. The New-thread button,
the navigation rail, and the footer stay host-rendered —
other plugins live in two of those, so a replaced list must not remove them.
Put your own controls at the top of your scroll area instead.

If no thread list plugin is enabled, bb shows a placeholder that links to
Plugins. If the active component throws, bb shows a "stopped working"
placeholder with a Reload button plus one toast; nothing else in the sidebar
is affected.

The component receives:

```ts
interface PluginThreadListProps {
  activeThreadId: string | null;
  activeProjectId: string | null;
  isCompactViewport: boolean;
  /** Closes the mobile drawer. Always call it after opening a thread. */
  onNavigate: () => void;
  /** Deprecated compatibility value for the removed sidebar search field.
      The host always supplies "". */
  searchQuery: string;
}
```

**Reading and acting on threads.** One hook reads the list; writes go through
the plugin SDK and navigation:

```tsx
const { status, threads, projects, sections } =
  experimental_useSidebarThreads();
const navigate = useBbNavigate();
navigate.toThread(thread.id, { split: true });
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, placement: { sectionId, pinned: false } });
const archiveEnvironmentThreads = experimental_useArchiveEnvironmentThreads();

// sections: PluginSidebarSection[] — { id, name, createdAt, updatedAt } in
// server order. A thread's `sectionId` names one of these or is null for the
// loose "Threads" bucket. Create, rename, and delete sections and move
// threads between them through the public API client; the sidebar refreshes
// over realtime:
const sdk = useSdk();
await sdk.threadSections.create({ name: "Later" });
await sdk.threads.update({ id: thread.id, sectionId });

// threads: PluginSidebarThread[] — id, projectId, href (put it on the row's
// anchor; the host routes clicks in place), title, titleFallback,
// displayTitle, parentThreadId, lifecycleOwnerThreadId, sourceThreadId, sectionId,
// originKind, originPluginId, providerId, status (execution status; busy
// threads sort first in bb's list), runtimeStatus (status refined by host
// readiness), queuedWork ("none" | "waiting" | "failed"), hasPendingInteraction,
// activity, isUnread/isPinned/pinnedAt/isArchived/archivedAt, pinSortKey
// (manual pin order),
// isHidden (bb's list filters these out; the array keeps them),
// environment { id, name, branchName, path, isWorktree, providerId,
// workspaceDisplayKind }, where workspaceDisplayKind is deprecated
// compatibility data; host { id, name }, createdAt, updatedAt, lastReadAt,
// latestAttentionAt, and `indicator` (bb's resolved status kind) +
// `indicatorLabel` (its a11y string). Draw your own glyph for `indicator`;
// the SDK ships no status component. Treat an unknown indicator, status, or
// runtimeStatus value as its documented fallback — bb adds kinds over time.

// Three more per-row facts are client-local, so they are hooks rather than
// fields on the thread: an unsent composer draft (bb paints a pencil, or a
// "working-draft" glyph when the thread is busy), a row status another
// plugin's app-wide script set (bb draws it in place of the draft glyph), and
// the jump shortcut bb assigns while the app command modifier is held (bb
// shows a key pill). Compose them with `indicator` yourself:
const { hasUnsubmittedDraft } = useSidebarThreadDraft(thread.id);
const rowStatus = useSidebarThreadRowStatus(thread.id); // { icon, label, tone? } | null
const shortcut = useSidebarThreadShortcut(thread.id); // { label, ariaKeyshortcuts } | null
const draftIds = useSidebarThreadDraftIds(); // ReadonlySet<string>, for group rollups
const rowStatuses = useSidebarThreadRowStatuses(); // ReadonlyMap, for group rollups
const splitLayout = useSidebarSplitLayout(); // { panes: [{ paneId, rect, threadId, isFocused }] } | null
// projects: PluginSidebarProject[] — { id, name, isPersonal, href, settingsHref }

// Titles can contain @project:, @section:, and @thread: mentions. `displayTitle`
// is the resolved plain text (sort on it, use it for aria-label); <ThreadTitle>
// renders the same text with bb's mention chips:
<span className="truncate">
  <ThreadTitle threadId={thread.id} />
</span>;

// `environment.providerId` names an entry in bb's environment provider
// catalog; resolve it for a display name, and draw it with
// <experimental_ProviderIcon providerKind="environment" provider={entry} />:
const { providers: environmentProviders } = useEnvironmentProviders();

// Pull requests are per row and opt-in — a lookup hits the git host, so it is
// deliberately NOT on the thread payload every sidebar loads:
const { pullRequest } = experimental_useSidebarThreadPullRequest(thread.id);
// → { isLoading, pullRequest: { number, title, url, state, attention } | null }

const navigate = useBbNavigate();
const sdk = useSdk();
navigate.toThread(id, { split: true }); // bb's split placement rules
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, focusPrompt: true });
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, placement: { sectionId, pinned: false } }); // file it under a section
navigate.toCompose({ projectId, environmentId }); // reuse an environment
await sdk.threads.pin({ threadId: id }); // optimistic in bb's surfaces
await sdk.threads.markUnread({ threadId: id });
await sdk.threads.update({ threadId: id, title: "New title" }); // silent; for inline editing
```

Archive and delete go through bb's thread menu (below), which owns the
confirmations: archiving a thread with children asks first and counts them,
and deletion always asks.

Unit-test a list with `renderSlot(...)` from `@get-bb/plugin-sdk/testing/app`:
seed rows with the `sidebarThreads` option (plus `sidebarDraftThreadIds`,
`sidebarRowStatuses`, and `sidebarShortcuts` for the per-row hooks) and assert against
`inspection.navigateCalls` and `inspection.sdkCalls`.

**Splits.** Rows can drag out to the split area:

```tsx
const { splitProps, isAvailable, layout } =
  experimental_useSidebarThreadSplit(thread.id);

<a {...splitProps} onClick={...}>
  {title}
  {/* layout is data: draw a mini-map, a tint, or nothing */}
</a>;
```

The host owns the gesture rules, including the one that matters if your list
has its own drag-to-reorder: a split drag engages only once the pointer leaves
the sidebar.

**bb's menu on your row.** Render `experimental_ThreadActionsMenu` and
`experimental_ThreadActionsContextMenu` around your row for bb's own thread
menu (archive and delete confirmation included) plus every plugin's thread
actions; see "An action in every thread menu".
`experimental_useArchiveEnvironmentThreads()` archives a whole environment
group with bb's pane cleanup and Undo toast.

**bb's status glyph on your row.** Render `experimental_ThreadStatusGlyph`
with the row's `indicator` (start from the thread's own, then fold in what
your row knows, such as collapsed children or `useSidebarThreadDraft`) and
`useSidebarThreadRowStatus(threadId)` as `rowStatus`; bb draws the same icon,
color, and accessible label its own lists use.

**Keyboard support is a DOM contract.** bb's thread shortcuts find rows by
query selector, not by React state. Put both attributes on each row's anchor or
the surface-specific numbered shortcuts, `thread.next`, and `thread.previous`
silently stop working:

```tsx
<a data-sidebar-thread-shortcut-target="" data-sidebar-thread-id={thread.id}>
```

### The provider directory

`experimental_useProviders()` returns `{ status, providers }` — every
registered agent provider in picker order, as the same `ProviderInfo` the
host's composer reads (`id`, `pluginId`, `displayName`, `family`, `icon`,
`logoUrl`, `available`, `capabilities`, `maintenance`, `extensionKinds`,
`composerActions`, and the declared `strings`, `reasoningLevels`,
`serviceTiers`). It reads the host's own cached roster, so
it costs no extra request. Use it whenever a surface shows a thread's or
automation's provider: never vendor provider names or copy in a plugin.

```tsx
const { providers } = experimental_useProviders();
const name =
  providers.find((provider) => provider.id === thread.providerId)
    ?.displayName ?? thread.providerId;
```

`status` is `"loading"` until the roster arrives and `"error"` when the request
failed; `providers` is empty in both cases, so fall back to the id. The
backend counterpart is `bb.sdk.providers.list()`. Keep the hook in the plugin
entry (`app.tsx`) and pass names down as props, so view components stay pure
and testable outside the plugin runtime.
