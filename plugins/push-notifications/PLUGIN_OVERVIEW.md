Get a notification when an agent asks a question, finishes a turn, or stops on an error. Choose mobile, web, and desktop delivery independently in Settings → Push notifications.

## Delivery

Mobile devices receive push messages through Expo, including when the app is closed. Web browsers and the desktop app receive system notifications over bb's live connection while a tab or window stays open; web delivery needs HTTPS (or localhost) and notification permission. Mobile WebViews use mobile push only.

Each thread has a level: `all` (questions, approvals, errors, finished turns), `input-only` (no finished turns), or `muted`. A thread uses its own level, else `childLevel` if it has a parent, else `defaultLevel`; every ancestor's own level caps it. Muting a parent mutes its whole subtree, but a parent never makes workers louder. The level applies on top of the suppressions below.

Click a notification to open its thread; on Linux desktop the click also restores and focuses the window. Events arriving together are combined, with pending questions taking priority. Read, archived, deleted, and hidden threads are suppressed. Tabs of the same origin deduplicate delivery.

## Thread menu

Every thread menu (header, sidebar row, right-click, compact drawer, optional row quick action) has a **Notifications** entry for unarchived threads: Default, All activity, Needs input only, Muted. The entry shows the current level; Default names its fallback; a footnote says when a parent limits it. Thread plugin metadata stores only a thread's own level, `{ "notifications": { "own" } }`; limits are read from the current parent chain. Menus fetch levels for threads on screen in batches.

## Settings

- `mobileEnabled` / **Mobile notifications**: send to registered phones and tablets. Default: true.
- `webEnabled` / **Web notifications**: notify connected browsers with permission. Default: true.
- `desktopEnabled` / **Desktop notifications**: notify running desktop clients. Default: true.
- `defaultLevel` / **Default notifications**: `all`, `input-only`, or `muted`, for threads you haven't set. Default: `all`.
- `childLevel` / **Child thread notifications**: `inherit` (same as `defaultLevel`), `all`, `input-only`, or `muted`. Default: `input-only`.
- `expoPushUrl` / **Expo push relay URL**: mobile relay endpoint. Defaults to `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`.

Channel switches apply to this server and save immediately. Browser permission is granted per device with **Allow notifications**. **Send test notification** confirms broadcast, not OS display.

## CLI and SDK

- `bb push-notifications list [--json]`: registered mobile devices, with redacted tokens.
- `bb push-notifications add --token <expo-push-token> --platform <ios|android> --label <device-label> [--json]`: register or refresh a mobile device.
- `bb push-notifications remove <id> [--json]`: remove a mobile device.
- `bb push-notifications status [--json]`: switches, defaults, relay, device count, and last mobile send.
- `bb push-notifications test <web|desktop> [--json]`: broadcast a test to connected clients of that type. Fails if the channel is disabled.
- `bb push-notifications thread <thread> [--level inherit|all|input-only|muted] [--json]`: print the resolved level and source; `--level` sets it.
- `bb plugin config push-notifications set <mobileEnabled|webEnabled|desktopEnabled> <true|false>`: change a channel.
- `bb plugin config push-notifications set <defaultLevel|childLevel> <level>`: change a default.

Every command takes `--help`. A failure with `--json` prints `{ "ok": false, "error": { "code", "message" } }` on stdout and the readable text on stderr.

Agents can use the SDK's plugin settings API for the same switches and `sdk.plugins.callRpc` with method `notifications.test` (`{ channel }`), `threadNotifications.list` (`{ threadIds }`, up to 200), or `threadNotifications.set` (`{ threadId, level }`). Permission requests still require a click in the target client.
